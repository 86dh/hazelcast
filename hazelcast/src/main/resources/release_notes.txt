This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast IMDG 3.12.12 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.

## Enhancements

* Updated the version of Hazelcast Kubernetes plugin to 1.5.5. [#17927]

## Fixes

* When the in-memory format of a map is `NATIVE` and the uploaded user code
has missing classes (in case the user code deployment feature is used),
the resulting exception could not be seen on the client side when a map query is run.
This was causing the client to hang indefinitely and fixed by improving the
failure handling for this case. [#18052]
