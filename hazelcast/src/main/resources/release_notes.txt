This document lists fixed issues for Hazelcast IMDG 4.1.4 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the updates made to a persistent map store might be lost
when the write coalescing is enabled. [#18924]
* Fixed an issue where the maximum size policy for a map was being ignored
when the policy is `PER_NODE` and the cluster is scaled down
(due to losing or killing a member). [#18871]
* Fixed an issue where the map's Near Cache was setting its maximum size as 10.000
even if the configured eviction policy is `NONE`. [#18834]
* The LRU eviction policy now takes last access time value into account to prevent
premature removal of the lately added but not yet accessed map entries. [#18632]
