This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast IMDG 4.2.4 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.


## Enhancements

For the distributions packages of IMDG, we updated the vulnerable version of log4j2 in Management Center to 2.17.0. No changes were made to the IMDG code.

IMPORTANT: The 4.2.4 release notes for the Hazelcast distribution on Maven wrongly states that
log4j2 version has been updated to 2.15.0; it should be 2.17.0.
