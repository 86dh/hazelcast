This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast IMDG 4.1.3 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.

## Enhancements

* Introduced a new mechanism in the background expiration tasks; 
now a thread local array controls the allocations for these tasks
otherwise which may cause increased garbage collection pressure
and CPU usage spikes when you use aggressive expiration configurations, e.g., low time-to-live values. [#18480]
* Updated the Hazelcast Kubernetes plugin dependency version to 2.2.2. [#18331]
* Added the ability to register the class definition of the parent generic record and check the class definition compatibility for nested portable fields. [#18284]

## Fixes

* The difference between the Near Cache configurations before and after
a client is recreated with the same client failover configuration is
fixed now. [#18361]
* The eviction of the idle entries is now stable in IMDG 4.x series
by aligning the behaviors of index-scan and full-scan in maps. [#18346]
* The `IllegalArgumentException` is not thrown anymore when there is Near Cache
configured for both the member and client sides for the same map and
`serialize-keys` option is `false`. [#18313]
