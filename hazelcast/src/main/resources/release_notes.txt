This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast IMDG 3.12.11 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.

==== 3.12.11 ====

1. New Features

* **Node Aware Partition Grouping:** Added the support of
partition grouping mechanism in the Hazelcast discovery plugin for Kubernetes.
You can create partition groups according to the name of the
node which is provided by this plugin and on which the containers/pods run.
See the NODE_AWARE section of the IMDG Reference Manual for more information.

2. Enhancements

* Added protection against XML External Entity attacks (XXE). [#17754]
* Introduced a configuration property to ignore errors during
enabling the XXE protection. This protection works with JAXP 1.5 (Java 7 Update 40)
and newer. When an older JAXP implementation is added to
the classpath, e.g., Xerces and Xalan, an exception is thrown.
The newly introduced property, namely `hazelcast.ignoreXxeProtectionFailures`,
allows you to ignore those exceptions.
See the System Properties appendix of the IMDG Reference Manual for more information.

3. Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the Javadoc of `release` methods for session-aware semaphore
structure was incorrectly addressing "threads" instead of "Hazelcast
instances". [#17828]
* Fixed a data loss issue that was happening while promoting a lite
member to a data member. [#17758]
